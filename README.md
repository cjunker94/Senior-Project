## Introduction

VR Traffic Dodge is a virtual reality video game designed for Oculus Rift. Taking inspiration from the arcade classic, “Frogger”, the objective of VR Traffic Dodge is for the player to cross a highway of traffic and other obstacles to reach the finish. Although there are many versions of this classic, Oculus offers the chance for a new perspective of it in virtual reality!

## Background

The Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset used in tandem with a computer and keyboard to immerse a player in a virtual experience. Unity is a game engine used to create video games.

## Methodology

VR Traffic Dodge is built and run in the game development platform Unity. Creating the world of VR Traffic Dodge was made possible by using Unity’s Asset Store, online documentation, and tutorials. Objects obtained from the Asset Store include the cars, buildings, road, water, trees, and sky. The scripting for the game was done in C#. Custom scripting was needed for the moving of cars, spawning cars and logs, moving logs, moving water, and user interface. The production of game objects required the manipulation of many materials and models. Object interactions were created by using mesh objects and triggers that produced a reaction for certain actions.

## Conclusion

Virtual Reality has arrived! With virtual reality making its way into the mainstream gaming industry, more people are getting the opportunity to experience the wonder of being immersed in a virtual world. Unity and other game engines make it possible for any programmer to create their own virtual reality for free. 

## Results

A functioning game to play on the Oculus Rift! Players will get the chance to interact with a virtual world and have the most unique way yet to play a classic game.
